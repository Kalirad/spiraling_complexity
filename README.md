# spiraling_complexity

A model of sequence divergence on a holey fitness landscape based on RNA folding to simulate the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. For more information see https://doi.org/10.1101/076232.

Contains the following files:

+ spiraling.nb: A mathmatica notebook demonstrating who to drive the modifeid Orr model and the number of inviable single   introgressions.

+ RNA_simulation.py: The model written in Python.

+ RNA_simulation_demo.ipynb: An ipython notebook showing RNA_folding_model.py in action.  

+ main_figures.ipynb: An ipython notebook which allows you to recreate the main figures from Kalirad & Azevedo 2017 from data in stats folder.

+ supp_figures.ipynb: An ipython notebook which allows you to recreate the supplementary figures from Kalirad & Azevedo 2017 from data in stats folder.

+ reference_seqs:  A series files containing reference sequences (FASTA format) for different alpha values used in our paper.
